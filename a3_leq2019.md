<h3>Overview</h3>

<body>
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) involves identifying the shortest possible route that passes through a list of cities and returns to the point of origin. It's a complex problem with no known efficient solution, referred to as NP-hard, implying that no known solution exists that can be calculated in polynomial time. Nevertheless, there are approximation algorithms such as Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Genetic Algorithm, which can determine solutions close to the optimal one. In this project, we'll apply the ACO algorithm to tackle the TSP issue. ACO is a metaheuristic (high-level problem-solving strategies that guide the exploration and exploitation of search spaces to uncover near-optimal solutions) inspired by the behaviour of ants searching for food. Ants in nature deposit pheromones while searching for food, and these pheromone trails guide other ants to the food source. In the ACO algorithm, artificial 'ants' traverse the problem space and modify it according to simple rules designed to guide subsequent ants toward promising solutions.

The essential steps of the ACO are as follows:

1. Initialization of Pheromone Trails: Create the idea of pheromone trails connecting the various attractions or cities, and initialize their intensity values.
2. Establishment of Ant Population: Generate a population of artificial ants. Each ant begins its journey at a different attraction.
3. Next Visit Selection for Each Ant: Determine the next attraction that each ant will visit. Continue this process until each ant has made a single visit to all attractions.
4. Pheromone Trail Update: Based on the movements of the ants, update the intensity of the pheromone trails. Take into account the evaporation of pheromones over time, which simulates the natural dissipation of these chemical markers.
5. Best Solution Update: From the total distances traveled by each ant, update the best solution. The best solution is typically the one with the shortest total distance.
6. Definition of Stopping Criteria: The procedure of ants visiting attractions is repeated for several iterations, with one iteration defined as every ant visiting all attractions once. The stopping criterion determines the total number of iterations to run. Allowing more iterations provides the ants with more opportunities to make better-informed decisions based on the evolving pheromone trails.

<h3>Preqrequisites</h3>
<body>
Installing matplotlib for graphing the results:
</body>

```python
pip install matplotlib
```

<h3>How were the cities and distances represented (as a data structure)?</h3>

<body>
<p>
 The cities are represented using a dictionary data structure where the keys represent the city numbers and the values are tuples containing the x and y coordinates of each city. This representation allows easy access to the coordinates of a city for distance calculation. Furthermore the distance are calculated using the distance formula square root of (x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2 which is use in calculate_total_distance function to calculate the total distance of the path.

```python
import random
import math

# Function to generate a set of cities with random coordinates
def generate_cities(n=5, width=200, height=200):
    random.seed(1)  # Seed the random number generator for consistent results
    cities = {}  # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the city coordinates
    for i in range(n):  # For each city
        x = random.uniform(0, width)  # Generate a random x-coordinate
        y = random.uniform(0, height)  # Generate a random y-coordinate
        cities[i] = (int(x), int(y))  # Store the coordinates in the dictionary
    random.seed()  # Reset the random number generator
    return cities  # Return the dictionary of city coordinates

# Function to calculate the distance between two cities using the Euclidean distance formula
def calculate_distance(cityA, cityB):
    xDis = abs(cityA[0] - cityB[0])  # Calculate the difference in x-coordinates
    yDis = abs(cityA[1] - cityB[1])  # Calculate the difference in y-coordinates
    return math.sqrt((xDis**2) + (yDis**2))  # Calculate and return the Euclidean distance

# Function to calculate the total distance of a route
def calculate_total_distance(route, cities):
    total_distance = 0  # Initialize the total distance
    for i in range(len(route) - 1):  # For each pair of cities in the route
        total_distance += calculate_distance(cities[route[i]], cities[route[i + 1]])  # Add the distance between the pair of cities to the total distance   
    total_distance += calculate_distance(cities[route[-1]], cities[route[0]])  # Add the distance from the last city to the first city
    return total_distance  # Return the total distance
```

<h3>How did you encode the solution space?</h3>

<body>
The solution space was represented as a list of city names (integers), where each list represented a route taken by an ant. The order of the city names in the list defined the order of the cities visited in the route.
</body>
<h3>How did you handle the creation of the initial ant population?</h3>
<body>
Each ant was initialized with a random starting city, and then it would construct a route by probabilistically choosing the next city to visit based on the pheromone levels and the inverse of the distance to the unvisited cities.

```python
# Function to create a route for an ant
def create_route(cities, pheromones, alpha, beta):

    start_city = random.choice(list(cities.keys()))  # Choose a random city as the start city 
    cities_left = list(cities.keys())  # Create a list of all the cities  
    cities_left.remove(start_city)  # Remove the start city from the list of cities left to visit
    route = [start_city]  # Initialize the route with the start city

    while cities_left:  # While there are cities left to visit
        current_city = route[-1]  # The current city is the last city in the route
        probabilities = []  # Initialize an empty list to store the probabilities
        for next_city in cities_left:  # For each city left to visit
            # Calculate the probability of moving to the next city based on the pheromone level and the inverse of the distance
            probabilities.append(pheromones[current_city][next_city] ** alpha * (1 / calculate_distance(cities[current_city], cities[next_city])) ** beta)
        total = sum(probabilities)  # Calculate the total of the probabilities
        # Initialize an empty list for the normalized probabilities
        normalized_probabilities = []

        # Iterate over each probability in the probabilities list
        for prob in probabilities:
            # Normalize the probability and add it to the list
            normalized_probabilities.append(prob / total)

        # Assign the normalized probabilities back to the probabilities variable
        probabilities = normalized_probabilities
        next_city = random.choices(cities_left, probabilities)[0]  # Choose the next city based on the probabilities
        cities_left.remove(next_city)  # Remove the chosen city from the list of cities left to visit
        route.append(next_city)  # Add the chosen city to the route

    return route  # Return the route 
```

<h3>How did you handle the updating of the pheromone trails?</h3>
<body>
The pheromones matrix was updated by decaying the existing pheromone levels and then adding pheromones to the paths used in the best route. The amount of pheromones added was based on the inverse of the best distance.

The pheromone trails are updated in two stages: evaporation and intensification.

1. Evaporation: In the evaporation stage, a certain percentage (defined by the evaporation rate or decay factor) of the pheromone on each edge evaporates to simulate the natural evaporation of pheromones. This is done by multiplying the pheromone value on each edge by (1 - decay factor).

2. Intensification: In the intensification stage, pheromones are added to the edges that were part of the best tours found in the current iteration (or all tours depending on the update rule used). The amount of pheromone added is usually proportional to the quality of the tour, i.e., 1 / tour length.

After a few trial run we notice that some of the best route distance would have low pheromone level and would not be selected by the ants. To solve this problem we implemented a elitism in the pheromone update where the best route would recieve extra pheromone than the rest of the routes. This would allow the ants to select the best route more often and would allow the algorithm to converge faster. The idea was inspire (Rochak Gupta) implementation of elitism.

        for j in range(len(pheromones[i])):  # For each element in the row
            pheromones[i][j] = (1 - decay) * pheromones[i][j]  # Decay the pheromone level

    for i in range(len(best_route) - 1):  # For each pair of cities in the best route
        city = best_route[i]  # The current city is the first city in the pair
        next_city = best_route[i + 1]  # The next city is the second city in the pair
        # Add pheromones to the path from the current city to the next city and from the next city to the current city based on the inverse of the best distance
        pheromones[city][next_city] += 1 / best_distance

    pheromones[next_city][city] += 1 / distance

    return pheromones  # Return the updated pheromones matrix
```

<h3>Which strategy(ies) did you use to compute the best solution?</h3>
<body>
The best solution (route) was computed by keeping track of the route with the shortest total distance throughout all the iterations.
</body>

<h3>Which stopping condition did you use? Why?</h3>
<body>
The stopping condition used was a fixed number of iterations (epochs). This was used because the performance of the algorithm can vary significantly with the number of iterations, and a fixed number allows for easy comparison of different configurations.

<h3>What other parameters, design choices, initialization and configuration steps are relevant to your design and implementation?</h3>
<body>
Several other parameters and design choices were made:

1. <b>n_cities</b>-the number of cities, which determines the size of the problem.
2. <b>n_ants</b>-the number of ants, which can influence the amount of exploration done in the solution space.
3. <b>epochs</b>- determines how many times the ants visit all the cities.
4. <b>decay</b> -the decay factor, which determines how quickly the pheromones evaporate.
5. <b>alpha and beta</b>-parameters, which control the relative importance of the pheromone level and the inverse distance, respectively, in the decision-making process of the ants.
6. <b>elitism_factor</b>-the elitism factor, which determines how many of the best routes add pheromones to the paths they used.

<h3>Which (simple) experiments have you run to observe the impact of different design decisions and parameter values?</h3>

Number of Cities: Increasing the number of cities increases the execution time as well as the best distance achieved. As the problem's complexity (number of cities) increases, the algorithm requires more computational power and time to find a good solution.

Number of Ants: Increasing the number of ants improves the quality of the solution (lower best distance), but also increases the execution time. More ants allow for more diverse exploration of the search space, improving the likelihood of finding better solutions, but at the cost of increased computation.

Decay Factor: Modifying the decay factor seems to influence both the best distance and execution time. It appears that a decay factor around 0.1 to 0.2 yields the best distance. This indicates that the amount of pheromone evaporation can significantly impact the performance of the algorithm.

Elitism Factor: The variation of the elitism factor, which controls the influence of the best-performing ant in the pheromone update, shows a noticeable effect on the best distance, with a value around 0.1 providing the best result in this experiment.

Alpha and Beta Parameters: Changing the relative importance of pheromone trails (alpha) and heuristic information (beta) affects the best distance and execution time. It appears that equal values (alpha: 1, beta: 1) or higher importance on heuristic information (alpha: 1, beta: 2) produce the best results in this case.

These experiments illustrate how different design decisions and parameter choices can affect the performance of the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm on the Travelling Salesman Problem. Such experimentation helps in understanding the balance between the quality of the solution and computational cost, and guides in fine-tuning the parameters for specific problem instances.
